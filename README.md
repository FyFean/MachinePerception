# Machine perception


This repository consists of five different machine perception projects written in Python with the help of Jupyter notebooks. A quick preview of every project is available just by clicking on any ipynb file but if you were to clone or download the repository to play with the code, a few installations are required.
 
### Prerequisites:
- First you must have Python installed on your computer
- In Visual studio code download the extension for Jupyter notebooks called Jupyter.
- Then use Python package installer pip to install the following (either use pip or pip3 depending on your version of Python):
```
    sudo pip3 install numpy
    sudo pip3 install opencv-python
    sudo pip3 install matplotlib
    sudo pip3 install ipympl
```

-  When opening a project you will notice, that these Jupyter notebooks are structured in blocks of code, that can be run by pressing the “play” button on the top left. For a project to work, all the blocks of code must be executed in descending order.
